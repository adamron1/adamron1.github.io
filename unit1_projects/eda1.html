		<h3>And this is my web page</h3>
		<h4>It's not very exciting or interactive yet</h4>
		<h5>But one day it might be super detailed, with lots of shiney bits</h6>
		<h6>And text of various sizes</h6>

		<p class ="bold" id="first_para">This is an example paragraph. It has an example of <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
		<p>This one below it has an example of <em>italicised </em> text. </p>
		<p class ="bold" id="third_para"> If you want to email me, all you have to do is click <a href = "mailto:adamron1@hotmail.com?subject=I'm%20so%20lonely%20that%20I%20decided%20to%20email%20you">here</a> (I wouldn't advise it though)</p>
		<p>Line breaks are useful<br> if you really like haikus <br> and HTML</p>
