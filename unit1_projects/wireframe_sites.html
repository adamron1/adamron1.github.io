	<h3>Facebook</h3>
	<br><img src="/unit1_projects/images/fb_wf.png"><br>
	<p>What is this page solving? <br>The challenge with facebook is that it is trying to put a lot of different options in your face without seeming like you're being bombarded. The content on your feed is generally generated specifically for you, and there is a lot of information and navigational options to explore. At the same time, I couldn't help but notice that much of the screen in empty/blank space. Most of the feed is in the centre, in a fairly thin divide that goes down indefinitely (there is no footer). This is essentially what you're here for, this is where the content that the user is mainly interested in goes. This aesthetic solves the problem of appearing simplistic while displaying a lot of content - it limits the width of that stuff that you're paying the most attention to. The header is bold and has strong, blue coloring, I suspect in order to not be so invasive, but also so you're aware of the branding- you are using Facebook, and it's very recognisable. The header is also fixed, so there's no escaping this. <br>The sidebars are set aside in a border effect- they are thin and out-of-the-way enough that they don't bother you. There's also some content in these, but its small font and pictures and the colors that blend into the background straight away let the user know that they are there in case they are needed, but they are not to be focussed on. <br>Within the content itself, the articles are divided into several subgroups - title, picture, caption, and comments. <br>The biggest challenge I think Facebook has is keeping the feed looking like it belongs to the user - nice and simple and uncluttered. When extensive advertising happens, that's what makes unwanted noise, and it makes it ugly. FB has chosen to put adverts in as faux posts, so one initially doesn't view it as an ad. While this is a little bit slimey on one hand, it also keeps the aesthetic of FB intact. </p>


	<h3>Pinterest</h3>
	<br><img src="/unit1_projects/images/pinterest_wf.png"><br>
	<p>Pinterest is kind of similar to FB in its content and goals. It is however, much more simplistic and it doesn't try so hard to eliminate clutter - at any one given moment there are rows and rows of pictures competing for your attention. The reak magic is keeping the pictures that are stored somewhere in the universe at a uniform standard, so it keeps with the layout of the page.<br>The header is very similar to the FB one, except that it is not trying so hard to draw your attention to the centre. This is because the content area below is very wide. A small logo in the centre-top, it is trying to be as inoffensive as possible - I think the idea is that the content is supposed to be more compelling to the user than the brand, which is where it deviates quiate a bit with FB, which has a very strong brand. <br>About the content: essentially the vast majority of the page is dedicated to the content, which is a large table with uniform column width. The pictures, which are what make up the content, are of similar slim, long dimensions, and there is very little information below. This makes the page extremely visually-focussed, without being bogged down by text. As mentioned on my <a href="/unit1_projects/blog-posts/week1_technical.html"/> blog</a>, it is aimed for visually-oriented people, who are not drawn so much to text as they are by design.</p>
	
	<h3>Codecademy</h3>
	<br><img src="/unit1_projects/images/CA_wireframe.png"><br>
	<p>This has 2 main parts to it - the homepage and the learning page.<br>The homepage: This is designed to be non-cluttered, easy to the eye and engaging. It's very simplistic too. The objective with this is for navigation- they want you to get to the lesson area, but outside of it they want everything to be simple and easy and pretty. I think this is to remove the practice of coding as being simply lines of code, and they want you to associate it with simplicity- it's all part of the lesson.

		The lesson page: This is where you are spending the most time (if you're engaged in the site), so wihle they've already drawn you in to an extent, it still needs to be simple and uncluttered. There is quite a easy-to-follow layout- the indstructions go on the left, the sample window is in the top-right corner, pointers to additional resources are in the footer and the bulk of the window is filled up with the text editor. While this isn't necessarily beautiful, I have seen some people's coding setups, and they generally look aweful! So to make it look uncluttered, with plenty of room for your thoughts is their aim. </p>
