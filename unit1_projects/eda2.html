		<h2>Pink Floyd</h2>
		<p>Pink Floyd was a psychedelic rock group to come out of the 60's. They were influenced by many groups of the time, but their use of sound design and strong song writing ability made them stand out from many groups of the era. Their music holds up to modern production standards despite the limiting and expensive technology of the time, with many listeners using <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> to test their sound systems. </p>
		<p>Notable albums by the quartet include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dark Side of the Moon</li>
			<li>Wish You Were Here</li>
			<li>Animals</li>
			<li>The Wall</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Dire Straits</h2>
		<p>A great example of guitar-driven rock, Mark Knofler led his band to fame with his unmistakable grumbling voice and his dynamic and unique guitar technique. They had a great many hits, and the band's ability to comfortably wow large venues and produce an excellet sound is legendary. Knofler, the star of the band, was known for his preference of playing without a plectrum, and thus achieving a wide variety of sounds from his guitar.</p>
		<p>Some songs worth listening to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Romeo and Juliet</li>
			<li>Sultens of Swing</li>
			<li>Brothers in Arms</li>
			<li>Private Investigations</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Bob Marley</h2>
		<p>An all around good musician, and someone I assume was an awesome guy, Bob Marley popularised Reggae music around the world. His beautiful dreads would inspire countless millions to do away with conventional hygiene for decades to come. He made some pretty awesome music too, and two of his sons are big names in the modern Reggae scene</p>
		<p>Some songs I'm <em>pretty</em> sure he wrote:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>I shot the Sheriff</li>
			<li>I shot the Sheriff's dad</li>
			<li>I stole the sheriff's wife and kids</li>
			<li>I'm the sheriff now</li>
		</ul>
