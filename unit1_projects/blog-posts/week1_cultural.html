		<h2>Initial EDA Thoughts</h2>
		<p>I took a look at Shereef's video just now, and it's really interesting listening to that guy talk. Clearly he's passionate about what Dev Bootcamp is doing, and it seems like the programme really is set up so that everyone can succeed. What has struck me is that there will probably be a few of the other cohorst that are way more experienced with IT than myself, and probably a bunch who have less experience too. It's humbling to think that we may well all be on the same boat in a few months time, and I can't wait to actually be able to do stuff! <br>My impression on EDA is that it's run by like minded people to Shereef, and that these are people who could easily be doing something else with their time. What I keep hearing is that it's how much you put in- nobody's going to guarantee that job, but if you work hard enough and are mindful of the people you work around, there's no reason that we won't benefit hugely. The other thing I keep hearing is how much of a challenge it's going to be in phase 1. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling this way - but at times I'm feeling overwhelmed already, and that's with a bit of prep prior to this course starting. I think it's good though, and if I look back, even to the start of the week, I can see how much more I know, and that's kind of exciting. <br>My expectations of EDA haven't really changed so much lately, when I heard about it in January I put myself into learning a bit more about it. And then with Patrick telling me he'd be teaching it, it made it all the more real. It makes all sorts of sense for this kind of education to occur- you learn best by emmersing yourself into something. I already feel liike my life is being steadily enveloped by development, and I realise more and more how this is a good decision, both in terms of learning the craft of software development and the experience itself. I think I'm so far doing a decent job, but it will be a completely new (and probably more intense) challenge to be around people who are equally and perhaps more devoted. All I can say is that I'm psyched to be learning so much, and I can't wait to use it.</p>
