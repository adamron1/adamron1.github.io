		<h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
		<p>This week we've been asked to look at the social phenomenon known as the <em>Stereotype Threat</em>. This is the way identity-based stereotypes can inhibit individuals' performance in a situation or context in which social identity appears to be relevent factor. In other words, people who are made aware of their differences to the group around them often perform differently as a consquence. There are a vast array of stereotypes that find their way into our heads, and if your social identity lines up with one of these stereotypes, you're probably more likely to dwell on it, whether you mean to or not.</p>
		<p>An example: I am a white, heterosexual male. This is probably the broadest social identity category I can put myself into, and luckily for me it is the most dominant, and therefore the 'safest' group one could conceavably be in. Lucky me. But even this sheltered, fortunate group can be affected by the stereotype threat. Let's say I'm back at school, and I go to Australia on a academic trip. Upon seeing the higher-quality facilities that this school has, I conclude that these guys must be smarter than us. And that's a significant factor, considering we're there to compete. Steele's thesis is that I and my compatriates would probably not perform as well, because we would be likely to feel threatened as an identity group. So in a fairly significant way, we would be disadvantaged by this fact.</p>
		<p>In that vague example it's hard to really feel sorry for me and my classmates - after all most other people have far more to deal with. Women are subject to situations like this constantly, as are minority ethnic groups. It's hard to put myself in the shoes of a woman who's the only one in her white, male dominated engineering workplace, or in those of a refugee child just starting school in a new country. I can only imagine that one would be constantly aware of the fact that in some way, whether significant or not, they are different to the other people in the room. Steele suggests that this manifests as a kind of distraction- instead of focusing entirely at the task at hand, the person has to be vigilent in order to be prepared for the 'threat'</p>
		<p>OK, so by now we should understand that negative stereotypes actually do affect us in our lives. What can we do about it? Probably the most effective thing we can do is introduce diversity into more aspects of our lives. This is easier said than done, but if it can be done it seems that it would be to everyone's benefit. For example, how could a someone working in a, say... IT environment possibly feel stereotype threat, if their coworkers are as unique and varied as they are? There's no sense of competition, so sense of trying to prove or disprove anything. You could simply work, with your mind on the job.</p>
		<p>In my own personal experience, I can't claim to have felt the racial or socioeconomic sting of stereotyes- again, I've won the lottery in that regard. But every individual has their own set of social identifiers that can affect them. I remember being a 'brainy' kid at primary school- thanks to social conditioning that basically meant that I wasn't destined to be a sportsman- something I probably would have prefered at the time. Looking back on it, the fact that I told myself that I was somehow not as good as my peers at sports meant that I wouldn't put the same kind of effort into it- so I performed conservatively. It affected me and these things that you conclude in your head about yourself only confirm themselves as you go, all the time limiting yourself. It's easy to see, on that note, why black college students in the US have a higher dropout rate- they find themselves in situations in which they feel implicitly disadvantaged. As people, one of the best things we can for ourselves is catch ourselves out when we are faced with stereotype threat, and just push through it. After a while, we'll realise that these things limit us, and we can achieve so much more than our surroundings might suggest.</p>
