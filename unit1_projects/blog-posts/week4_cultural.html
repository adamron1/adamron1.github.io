		<h2>Internet Freedom</h2>
		<p>This week I am going to touch briefly on an issue that affects almost everybody in the world- the question of internet freedom. This is an extremely complex issue, and one which governments, individuals and interest groups are all playing a major role in an idealogical conflict, which may ultimately dictate the role of the internet in the future.</p>

		<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
		<p>The internet was originally designed by the US military as a way to establish communication over a long distanct. It wasn't until the 90's that the World Wide Web was popularised and made available as a platform that your everyday Joe could contribute to- and since then its use has exploded, propelling the world into what we call the digital age- where technology, market and scientific developments have been accelerated. As the internet has been used as a platform to bring the people of the world together in various ways, it has had a tremendous impact on everybody. It has affected how we consume media, the widespread use of the English language, the global reach of democracy and the Global marketplace. While some changes have been positive, others are arguably not.</p>

		<h3>What's this got to do with Internet Freedom?</h3>
		<p>With the aforementioned world changes, it's easy to see why the internet has been a catalyst for change. Let's use the democratisation of many countries as an example. If a country has an uncensored, unregulated platform for people to connect and communicate, its government has to be more accountable for its actions. The media is more far-reaching, people are generally more educated, marginalisation and human rights abuses are discovered by everyone- the people can be more civically active than before. Experts attribute the Arab Spring of 2012 as an example of constituants organising popular revolutions (which are admittedly double-edged swords) through social media.
			<img src="http://www.shajiullahfirasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fb.jpg"><br>In response to these potential threats to establised power structures, many governments, even the <em>friendly ones</em> are worried, and opt to either censor the contents of the internet or monitor the use of the internet by its citizens. Both of these tactics are responses of fear- established power structures clinging onto having an edge over the people they serve. We are used to this behaviour from despots - North Korea is an exaggerated example of the dangers of censorship and no real freedom for the people. They have no power to even be informed of how sh***y their situation is- and thus no action will occur, the military will continue to rule, the people will continue to live in adverse conditions. There is no opportunity, and no clear way to break the cycle from the bottom (which is exactly the opposite of what Democracy and popular revolution stand for).</p>

		<h3>How does this affect me?</h3>
		<p>Well, we live in a pretty good situation in terms of... well, everything. Our democratic values and global connectedness are very healthy, and in theory, self-perpetuating. In such a society, where corruption is basically non-existant and political trust is apparently invested in the people (and education is good), there should be no reason to censor or restrict the internet's contents. Despite this, it's happening here in some capacity. Not wanting to sound like a conspiricy nut, revelations like from Julien Assange and Edward Snowden indicate that those power structures that have served us pretty well in the past have a tendency to cross a line that we as individuals are not completely comfortable with. It's all over the news, the NSA stores data on a lot of people without the legal authority to. And it's no different here in NZ - the GCSB has a direct relationship with them, and we can pretty much assume they're doing the exact same thing.
			<br>This isn't necessarily a bad thingon it's own, after all- what do you have to hide? Your crappy blog? Well, it's a question of whether such actions 1) do actually keep us 'safe' and 2) the potential abuse of power. With a stroke of a pen you could be declared a terrorist because you bought '1984' from Amazon that one time. And before you say "well, that's ridiculous", remember that all it takes is another 9/11 for everyone to go slightly insane.</p>
		<h3>What can you do about it?</h3>
		<p>Hmm, it seems that despite writing an entirely too long-winded blog, I'm not that clear on the steps one can take to ensure a free internet5 future. Also, I've failed to mention some of the pitfalls of internet freedom- such as the new world of piracy and other non-ethical practices that a free internet allows (and that we all exploit, let's face it). 
			<br>Anyway, what you can do for this cause doesn't have to be crazy - you don't have to join <em>Anonymous</em> or anythig. You can raise this with your preferred political group(s), and hear their opinion, and if they don't have one, urge them to make one. This is a very topical issue which ALL countries EVERYWHERE are facing, and just because we're on the 'winners' side in terms of being a pretty rich country which is friends with everyone, doesn't mean we should settle with compacency in what is a real issue. For more on the subject (which would amze me if you've read this far- I've really done a good session of verbal diarhea), check out the video below.</p>
