		<h2>Good websites: an Analysis</h2>
		<p>It takes a lot (I assume) to make a well designed, aesthetic and easy-to-operate website. I'm only just begging to get a loose grasp on making mine look not-completely-vomit-inducingly-terrible. Some sites that have capured my limited attention are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Facebook</li>
			<li>Pinterest</li>
			<li>Codecademy</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let's get into a bit more detail:</p>
		<h4>Facebook</h4>
		<p>OK - This is obviously as successful as a web destination could possibly be. It is by far the most popular social networking site, and as it followed in the ashes of the now cring-worthy <em>Myspace</em> and <em>Bebo</em>, it was far from guaranteed its success. A lot of people regularly spend a large portion of their internet usage here, and it can't be due solely to the functionality of the application.</p>
		<p>I would argue that Facebook is an extremely well designed web application. It limits the use of colors to a non-offensive blue and white combo, and the layout of one's feed is designed to give you plenty of bank space. I'm sure this is done so it seems less cluttered, so users don't feel a sudden urge to get up and get on with their outside lives. An adjective I'd use to describe the layout is 'simple', or at least designed to appear 'minimalist'.  </p>
		<p>Aside from its layout, facebook is extremely easy to navigate. The fact that my mum has an account is testimony in itself - if she can do it, anyone can. You always know how to get back to your homepage, how to add content, and find other peoples' pages. It manages to get people hooked rather than frustrated. This is without even mentioning the functionality of the site- which is huge- you can play games, find pages, and connect with people you met that one time at a party 15 years ago in the middle of the desert. So, I'd say it's pretty impressive, even if many people who use it spend WAY to much time on it.M<br></p>

		<h4>Pinterest</h4>
		<p>I am not a user, and probably never will be, but I will say that this is a pleasant and well-designed site. First of all- it's not taking on a whole lot of things- it's essentially just a clipboard for pictures that you can find all over the internet, that you can tag or 'pin'- which makes the picture more popular and thus it's 'rank' must go up. I guess. So that's all it does- you can categorise your clipboards and theme them, but essentially it's just a bunch of pictures.</p>
		<p>Why is this good? Because it is designed in a way that each picture has a limited amount of real-estate, and they all fit together nicely. It's also a responsive website, that's equally as easy to navigate from a mobile device.</p>
		<p>If I were to describe Pinterest's aesthetics in a few words, I would say 'pretty', 'simple', and 'smooth'. As a user, I see that it engages people in a way that other websites do not- particularly for those of us who are visual learners. For example, my girlfriend loves it - she is very visual in her thought pattens - and by eliminating the 'noise' of the internet and just focussing on pictures, she gets a lot more enjoyment and inspiration than on a wordy, technical site.<br></p>

		<h4>Codecademy</h4>
		<p>Firstly, I'd like to say that this is a VERY good primer for anyone who wants to learn about coding languages. It's fairly new, and it's easy to see where the inspiration comes from- the internet is full of technical resources, but a beginner often doesn't know where to look and gets bogged down by how boring it seems, and how little progress one seems to make at first. These guys have built the site with the end-user in mind- probably mostly for people in high-school looking at coding, but accessible to anyone who has english as a first language. </p>
		<p>They focus quite heavily on keeping the user motivated- this is done through the website's focus on nice design, it's built-in interpreter for the code (that sits in the top-right corner), and its 'gamification' of goals. <br>The design is again, simple and not cluttered, and focusses on different areas of learning. They try to keep as little in the way of you getting to the lesson screens as possible. It's light, and the mood of the site is quite light too, with a lot of content being whimsical and intended to keep users from getting <em>too</em> frustrated (as coding is sometimes pretty frustrating). <br>The built-in interpreter for the lessons is another key- it doesn't rely on the student intalling this and that, and everything works fast. You can see the results of your work straight away. This is a big deal - as it is working in many ways to keep the user from packing it in. With the onterpreter in the top corner, out of the way, and the instructions in a side bar to the left, you can see what's going in, and nothing is competing for your attention. Also the use of dark colors makes it seem slightly cooler and differentiates it from a text editor.<br>The third feature of the website's that I'll discuss is its approach to learning objectives through gameification. It means that user motivations are spurred on by a rewards system, in this case 'badges'. This gives the user a feeling of achievement, and helps with the realisation that after only a few hours work, you can suddenly do something you couldn't before.
