		<h2>Javascript</h2>
		<p>This week we've been learning about Javascript. It's been very different to the design and UX focus that we've had before, so at first it's easy to miss why we should learn it. In this article I'll attempt to explain why Javascript is so widely used, what sets it apart from the rest, and also why it's not the best in some things.</p>

		<h3>Why is Javascript so popular?</h3>
		<p>JS is a scripting language, which essentially means that you (the user of a program) only get a bunch of text, and a javascript file is really very little more than this. Your browser or whatever interpreter you use (for example node) then parses the instructions from it, meaning that it is a front end language that uses the user's computer, and does not rely on the computing power of a server somewhere. This is generally a good thing, as when you work more with back-end stuff you don't want everything to come from a server- many hands make lighter work. It also runs very quickly for a scripting language, which is an advantage it has over many other scripting languages, such as python.</p>

		<p>Apart from this, JS is quite friendly to those who code. It has a hugely extensive library, and more people out there know javascript than pretty much anything else. It's not going, away by the looks of things. This comes with a lot of good support, so if you're stuck on anything you can be guaranteed that the solution's out there, a google search away. With all this comes the fact that it's not THAT complicated as far as languages go (or so I'm told). </p>
		<p>It's not all roses though. JS finds itself under quite a lot of scrutiny. Despite being pretty good at what it does, it's not perfect. In fact, prbably the main reason it is so popular is not because it's amazing; rather that it's popularity has reached a critical mass- it's all over the internet, supported by virtually all browsers on virually all platforms. The main technical problems people have with JS are quite specific and usually semantic. For example, it is apparently not good with bitwise operators. However, that's something I struggle to understand, so it's not quite fair for me to judge it too much on that point. </p>
