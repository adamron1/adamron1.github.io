		<h2>Loops in Ruby</h2>
		<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RB8xTkXubgk/Ut2pjQOAFRI/AAAAAAAACiw/pxRO2YRFL_0/s1600/in.png">
		<p>Loops are great. They're the reason computers can do all sorts of complex and computing equations that would take normal humans a very long time to come up with. And because computers are so good at performing equations, it makes sense to use them to search, to sort data, to add stuff to other stuff, and what have you. Generally in computer science there are 2 main kinds of looping conventions - a 'for' loop and a 'while' loop. In this blog, I'll cover these, and go into a brief discussion on some of Ruby's simplified methods which make looping more accessable for many people.</p>
		<h3>The 'while' loop</h3>
		<p>The while loop works as it sounds. While a condition is met (true), the following formula keeps going and making its appropriate calulations. This is useful in instances where we don't have a definite limit on how many loops we want to go through. For example</p>
		<p><strong>while x < y {x++} </strong></p>
		<p>This loop is relatively simple- it means that the loop will not stop until x is matching or a higher value than y. AND we can keep iterating however many times neccessary until the condition is met. The problem many people face with this however, is that it is easy to get yourself into an infinite loop- which your computer will no appreciate that much! To avoid this, look carefully at your conditional statement, and make sure that the condition will eventually be met!</p>
		<h3>The 'until' Loop</h3>
		<p>This is another way to phrase a 'while' loop- just the reverse. It will continue looping <em>until</em> the stated condition is true- whereas with a while loop it is waiting for the condition to prove false. There are very few instances where you really need this as opposed to a 'while', but if it helps you understand, power to you.</p>
		<strong><p>until x > y {x++}</strong> </p>
		<h3>The 'for' loop</h3>
		<p>This is the other major looping method aside from 'while'. This loops through a specified range and iterates ONLY within this range. This means you avoid the trappings of accidently falling into an infinite loop (you can still do it though). This is particularly useful when you apply it to data sets, such as arrays, hashes or strings.</p>
		<p><strong>for i in [1,2,3] {print i} #=>123</strong></p>
		<p>As demonstrated above, this will go througfh each item in an object(in this case an array) starting at the first instance '[0]'. This is easy enough to use, but can get quite clunky when dealing with datasets with an unknown quantity of data. Also, rubyists don't really use it much because there are more eloquent ways (thanks to some syntactic sugar) to do essentially the same thing.</p>
		<h3>The .each Method</h3>
		<p>So, this is the most common way to flip through each item in a dataset. As suggested in the name, it goes through 'each item'. The nice thing about this is that you can put a loop eloquently into a single line.</p>
		<p><strong>[1,2,3].each {|x| puts x}</strong> #=>123</p>
		<p>As shown above, this loop runs through each element in the array and performs the subsequent operation. 'x' represents the content of the each iteration, as opposed to the index. This is pretty nice in this situation, but in others it may no quite suit your needs- you may prefer to have an <strong>index</strong> to refer to rather than what is contained inside the array. For that though, it might be useful to use the next type of loop</p>
		<h3>The .times Method</h3>
		<p>This is another 'for' spinoff that covers a specified range, but this time you specify EXACTLY how many loops you want to do.</p>
		<p><strong>[1,2,3].length.times {|x| print x}</strong> #=>012</p>
		<p>See? It's a little bit different than the each method. Here, 'x' referred to the index - ie the placeholder of each item in the array that the loop went through. Also, we know that the loop only went through 3 times, since the [1,2,3].length is 3. That's it - no infinite loops here!</p>
		<p>I hope this has been useful to you, and that it is true!</p>
