		<h2>Thinking and Learning</h2>
		<p>I am mostly an absract sequential thinker. I found this out a few weeks ago and I realised I had no idea what that really meant. Also, I tested to be equally abstract random, but decided I didn't like that one as much! So, I got this little table which summarised the different learning styles:</p>

		<p>There were a couple of points to consider here. What is the best way for me to learn? Well, according to my designated thining style, I learn best when I can work alone, have access to good resources and am in a stimulating environment. These are all true as far as I can see, and the same goes for the points for abstract random thinkers- I like to be given broad guidelines, maintain friendly relationships and participate in group activities. So, it's a little bit vague as to exactly what box I fit in best, but it can be assumed that 'Absract' is me.  </p>
		<h4>How does my thinking style affect my progress with EDA?</h4>
		<p>So far the EDA experience has been a little bit removed. We've mostly been given some specific(ish) tasks with a broad pool of readings and resources. This has, for the most part, been to my benefit, as I do prefer being able to work alone- it's certainly when I'm at my most productive. So far my biggest technical struggle has been html/css - not because they're so hard to work, but because I feel overwhelmed by design considerations. This is apparently something my thinking style finds difficult- learning something without getting to know a subject thoroughly. As a result of this, I've actually spent more time on my index page, patching it up than I had on Javascript this week- which I'm more comfortable with. I hadn't really stopped to ponder why I was doing this, and here I am on a Sunday trying to get my 'homework' in on time! Perhaps a good strategy is timeboxing- I tend to get stuck on a particular problem and I stubbornly pick at it while the clock counts down. If I set my work times, I can allocate time for doing what I 'have' to do, and put spare time into learning those other bits that end up consuming me.</p>
		<h4>Growth vs. Fixed mindset</h4>
		<p>I've also found that my attitude/minset toward the more designy bits of our course hasn't been the most productive. I have been slightly resistant towards web design, mostly because I consider it a whole new mountain to climb, and I'm right at the bottom. This week I have been trying to congratulate myself on the small victories I get, which are mostly focusing on re-sprucing up my index page. The progress is still slow, but I compare it to what I did before and it makes me pretty happy. Here's a preview:</p>
		<img src="http://adamron1.github.io/unit1_projects/images/indexpg.png">
		<p>So, a strategy I will adopt to keep myself in the growth mindset is to read/research beyond the curriculum. As long as I don't limit myself to the minimum learning competencies, I can look at each exercise like a new field of stuff to learn. The downside of that is that I shut off if I don't think I can learn everything in time- so, I'll allocate specific blocks of time to work on my homework, and then the rest will be 'homework+'. I finally have the free time to do it, and I'm here to learn, so why not?</p>
