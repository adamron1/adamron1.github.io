		<h3>Week One</h3>
		
		<h4><a href="unit1_projects/eda1.html">First Web page</a></h4>
		<span><a href="#" class ="show">[show]</a><a href="#" class ="hide">[hide]</a>
		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>My first Web Page</h3>
			<p>The content here isn't all that amazing, but it was good to see something I made up and running. Not much consideration for design, but it can only get better, right?</p>

		<h4><a href="unit1_projects/eda2.html">Second Web page</a></h4>
		<span><a href="#" class ="show">[show]</a><a href="#" class ="hide">[hide]</a>
		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>My Second Web Page</h3>
			<p>The task was to write about stuff that we like, so I decided to write a teeny bit about some of my favourite musical groups. By the end, I was getting a bit tired with making good content, but the real challenge for me was making it semi-presentable, and doing some CSS stuff. It doesn't look amazing, but I was pretty happy with it at the time.</p>

		<span><a href="#" class ="show">[show]</a><a href="#" class ="hide">[hide]</a>
		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>Technical Blog: Website Analysis</h3>
			<p>This was my first-ever go at writing a blog, technical or otherwise. In this, I write about 3 websites that I use, and what about their design makes people like them. It's not that pretty, but as you can see, it's getting better!</p>

			<h3>Cultural Blog: Initial EDA thoughts</h3>
			<p>In this blog, I write about my initial thoughts on what I thought EDA/Dev Bootcamp was all about (at the time of writing). </p>

		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>Technical Blog: Padding, Margins and Borders</h3>
			<p>This was a quick guide of the differences between padding, margins and borders on html.css. Pretty basic content, but if it's something you're struggling with, I hope this provides clarity.</p>

		<span><a href="#" class ="show">[show]</a><a href="#" class ="hide">[hide]</a>
		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>Wireframe Analysis</h3>
			<p>This was an exercise where I took some wireframes from the sites I had mentioned in my previous technical blog, and attempted to analyse them from a design perspective</p>

		<div class = "appear" id="firstpage">
			<h3>My Wireframes</h3>
			<p>This was my attempt at wireframing my own webpage. Utimately, I haven't gone with this design, as I ran with it for a bit and I felt like it didn't look very good at all. </p>

			<h3>Javascript</h3>
